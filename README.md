Business Cycle Measurement Colombia

Build models of aggregate economic activity that can explain why business cycles exist.
Understand the key features that we observe in economic data that define a business cycle.
Beyond the study of the measurement of gross domestic product (GDP), and other macroeconomic variables

We know that business cycles are quite irregular, in that the changes in real GDP are unpredictable; macroeconomic forecasters often have difficulty predicting the timing of a business cycle upturn or downturn. Business cycles are quite regular, however, in terms of comovements, which is to say that macroeconomic variables move together
in highly predictable ways. We focus separately on the components of real GDP, the price level and inflation, and labor market variables.
